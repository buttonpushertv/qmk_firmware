Attempting to create a '2nd Keyboard' out of a Gherkin based on the work here:

--> Taran's github: https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard


Taran's project made use of a HASU USB-to-USB converter. I wondered if it was possible to
flash any QMK-capable keyboard with the same code. It's a default Gherkin layout with the
F24-wrapping code at the tail end.
