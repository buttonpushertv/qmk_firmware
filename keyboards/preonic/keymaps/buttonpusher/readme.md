# BUTTONPUSHER's Preonic Keyboard

This layout started out based on the **Default Preonic** Layout. My Preonic serves primarily as a 2nd keyboard for my laptop on my desk at work. In an effort to reduce desktop clutter, I prefer the smaller footprint of this keyboard. Additionally, since my laptop usage, while at work is sparse, I often find myself moving only my left hand between my main keyboard and the Preonic. So, I've devised this layout to facilitate working one-handed (while also trying to minimize the layers and things I need to remember about using this keyboard).

# LAYERS

## (Default) QWERTY Layer

{image here of DEFUALT LAYER}

Pretty standard Preonic layout. Since my Rev. 3 doesn't have backlighting, I have opted to move CONTROL to the bottom leftmost key. ALT is the second key in from left along bottom row. GUI/OS key is 3rd key in from left, along bottom row. The fourth key in from the left, along bottom row activates the DIRECTIONAL layer (see below).

## LOWER Layer

Single handed operation means that the Function Keys are clustered predominantly under the left hand. F1-F16 are easily reachable on the left. F17-F24 are harder to reach on the right, but they are far less used. A few shortcuts (CALC, WEB HOME) and handy modifiers (INS & CAPS) are in the center along with a simple macro for a word I constantly type for emails, etc: _'buttonpusher'_. The addition of a DELETE key at the SPACEBAR also cuts down on reaches up to the upper right corner (helpful when only using the left hand).

## RAISE Layer

Setup for single handed usage, most of the punctuation is available on the right side. Even though several of the basic punctuation marks _are_ available via the shifted versions of their default keys, stretching your hand all the way across the keyboard to get a double quote or colon can be a difficult reach. The right side allows access to all the punctuation marks so that you can more easily reach them while pressing the RAISE key. The addition of a BACKSPACE key at the space bar also cuts down on reaches up to the upper right corner (helpful when only using the left hand).

The bottom right holds the HOME, END, PGUP, & PGDN keys under logical arrow keycaps.

Along the left side of this layer are several keys setup for use with a concept I refer to as SCAF. Simply described, SCAF keys are just FUNCTION keys with the SHIFT, CONTROL, & ALT modifiers applied. It is part of a more **Meta Concept** I use when integrating programmable keypads or macropads into my workflow. Using these SCAF keys allow me to setup a standard set of available keys for use in applications that allow user-definable keystrokes (Adobe Creative Cloud apps, for instance). I also have several AutoHotKey macros setup that are triggered by SCAF keys. Having a standard, but flexible set of keys allows for on-the-fly configuration of inputs to allow for increased efficiency & reduction of repetitive tasks.

## DIRECTIONAL Layer

Even though, I use a Logitech MX Ergo Trackball that has a handy ability to toggle between 2 systems easily, sometimes it's just as easy to control the mouse via the keyboard. Additionally, there are several mouse functions made available that may not always appear on mice (e.g.- buttons 3, 4, & 5 or horizontal scrolling), so having them here is a bonus.

The bottom right holds media control keys. I rarely use them, but they are nice to have available.

Additionally, I make heavy use of AquaSnap - an app for controlling window placements on the Windows desktop. The top row is comprised of keys that press the corresponding NUMPAD numeral comnbined with the GUI key as a modifier.

## ADJUST Layer (Lower + Raise)

Pretty much the typical adjust layer. This is where you can access the QWERTY Double Tap layer (see below).

Again, making things easier to access via one hand, this layer replicates the Default QWERTY layer, but nearly all of the keys gain a tap dance function of adding CONTROL to each keystroke (single tap gets you the unmodified key - a double tap gets you the key plus CONTROL). Again, this is more for the convenience and ease of getting CONTROL-versions of those keys on the far right side of the keyboard without having to stretch your hand.

### NOTES

- I don't have much need for straight NUMPAD keys, but it would be easy to add those on their own layer.

- I do not make use of Colemak or Dvorak, so those have been removed to keep the size of the .bin file smaller. They could easily be added back in, if you needed them.

- Additionally, I've removed the backlighting controls since my Rev. 3 Preonic doesn't have any lighting (yet). If you wanted it, you could easily add it back in.
