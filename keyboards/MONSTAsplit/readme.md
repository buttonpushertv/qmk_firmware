Currently this is the [keyboard layout](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/b4d43056227ca0e67f6b3863d2557ae3) - if you wanted to use this as a full, 165% split keyboard.

If you want a compact 88% board, you can use only one of the halves to get [this layout](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/59b19110a1d9f52150dbf173dfed2f5c)

**IMPORTANT NOTE** This keyboard *is not* a true split keyboard (ala - Ergodox, etc).
The MONSTAsplit is 2 individual keyboards that are setup to work together as a 'fake-split' keyboard. This means that layer toggles pressed by one hand cannot change layers on the opposite hand. Standard modifiers (Shift, Control, Alt, OS) will work normally.
